# NewsFeed Package 
This Repository is a Package for the FrikyBot.

The NewsFeed Package displays Updates and Changelogs to the User. Using a News- and Changelog-Maker new entrys can be added and changed easily.

Note: This is Code cant be run on its own, its still tied to the FrikyBot Interface and Ecosystem!

## Getting Started
This Package is powered by Node.js and some NPM Modules.

All dependancies are:
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - providing File and API Routing Capabilities

Installing a Package is very easy! Clone this Package to your local machine, wrap it in Folder Named "NewsFeed" and drop that into your FrikyBot Packages Folder.
Now use the FrikyBot WebInterface and add the Package on the Settings->Packages Page.

## Features

### News
The Newsmaker mainly hosts News Articles including Images, Texts and Misc-References to other Sources. News can be sheduled to be published when available.

### NewsMaker
The NewsMaker is a WebInterface where you can add or change text, images and more to a News Article. Using the live preview a desired look can easily be achieved.

### Changelogs
Changelogs are a list of Changes. These can be confusing and complicated to follow - thats where this System tries to improve with many small improvements.

## ChangelogMaker
The ChangelogMaker makes adding Changes very easy - its still quite complicated, i admit. But there will be a v2.0 that generates a changelog automatically ;)

## Planned Features
* **More News Layouts** - More Text fields, image locations and Misc References.
* **Auto Changelog** - Given a list of Changes, the Bot should automatically generate a Changelog.
* **Social Media Publication** - Announce News and Changelogs on Twitter, Discord or even GitHub!
